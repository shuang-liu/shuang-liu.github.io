### About

I am a fifth-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I am currently working with Professor [Hao Su](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/) on theory and applications of machine learning. I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
